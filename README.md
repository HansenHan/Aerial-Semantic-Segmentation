# Aerial-Semantic-Segmentation

This is a semantic segmentation problem from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bulentsiyah/semantic-drone-dataset
We use Mask R-CNN and U-Net to solve this problem. 
For Mask R-CNN model, you need to upload both original images and labeled mask to your google drive, and then use colab for model training and testing.
